IOP Support Added. 
'IOP Modules' node in tree view added allowing listing of currently loaded modules for connected target - this gives equivalent of dsilist - (Use right-click context menu or F5 to update). 
Load & Run IRX module dialog added for downloading (and running) IOP modules.
Kernel Flashing updated - now can update kernels on devtools *FROM ANY* rom ver. *TO ANY* rom ver (romflash loader (rfld.elf) no longer required). Crisis recovery option added to recover from corrupted flash images.
'NO STOMP' added for dsedb/dsidb users - Target Manager will no longer override these debug sessions.
'Force Disconnect' facility added to forcibly remove all connections to a target... use with care :-)
Steve's Split Pane Container replaces old splitter system so now split position is persisted between sessions.
Keyboard shortcut clash fixed in Target menu - short cut for Load & Run ElF is now 'E'.
Get Connect Status (Press F5 in Target Summary View) - displays connection status for all listed targets.
Target Summary sorted by either name or ip address (click appropriate column) and persisted between sessions.
Double click on target in Target summary view to connect/disconnect

Command line parameters can now be specified when downloading an ELF file via the Load & Run ELF File dialog.
Keyboard shortcuts added as follows:- (C)onnect, (D)isconnect, (R)eset, Insert = Add target, Delete = Delete target, TAB/SHIFT+TAB = Switch between left/right view window.
Delete target confirmation dialog added.

2.21e 	16/3/00
Command line options added as follows to allow almost complete control of target manager from command line. See DOCS for details on how to use or type "ps2tm -?" for help. 
Boot parameters are now properties of each target and are stored along side other parameters in the ini file (default to -1).

2.2 	15/2/00
* Browse for folder dialogs always default to root regardless of current settings - FIXED - now default to 
current settings for that target.
* The [X] button in the caption bar and the "Close" option in both "File" and system tray menus NOW CAUSE THE TARGET MANAGER TO EXIT . The app can still be hidden by either clicking the minimize button or choosing the "Hide" menu option in the system tray menu.
* The main window position and state is now persisted to the ps2tm.ini file. To have the app startup as MINIMIZED/HIDDEN, first hide it (by clicking the minimise button or choosing "Hide" from the system tray menu) and then exit the app. When restarted the app will start in the hidden state.
* Fixed bug which causes PS2TM to not always locate the correct ini file (by default it should use the ini file located in the same directory as ps2tm.exe).

2.1 	2/2/00
Fixed problem where deleted pointer was causing PS2TM.EXE to hang during certain fileserve operations.
Splitter is now positioned in absolute terms, not relative.
Fixed splitter update problem where garbage sometimes left on screen.

Fileserving Information has been added to show files open and bytes read/written.
Targets are now stored in ini file to allow easy moving (PS2TM.INI in same dir as PS2TM.EXE).
